Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis Case Study

Introduction


Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this project, I have undertaken the role of a junior data analyst at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The primary goal is to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently to design a new marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.
